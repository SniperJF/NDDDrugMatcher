#Second phase later (with old code?) we can try to find partial matches by searching for individual words that match
iTMLP1 = [] #Independent Trial Match List Phase 1, Each entry holds:
# [  Matched Drugname, List of NCTID of Trials Matching (2 or more), Most recent last posted date of the set of trials  ]

#So my plan for this is to for first pass to simply try hashing the objects using intervention and intervention_other_name as keys
#and then store for value a list of NCTID (so in case of collision we store them all). Store this in iTMDP1

#When done we look through at any key/value pair that has more than 1 trial stored. Then we check to see if there is at least 2 trials
#with different NDD. If so this is what we want so we add an entry into iTMLP1 so we can add it to our Table 1 results.

#Then for the second pass we can try the same hash approach but by using individual words as keys but before we do that we want to 
#look at the word and see if it's a stopword so we can skip those. Other than that we do the same process.
