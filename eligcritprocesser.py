#This file was born out of necessity. I need to run a lot of my existing code, but modified, to process these trials where
#the eligibility criteria contains a Neurodegenerative Disease (NDD) meaning the subjects of the trial may have that NDD.
#Because of this, these trials are of interest and I have created these csv files containing a list of NDD the trials 
#mentioned, the 3 files created contain either 
# 1) a single NDD detected that we then found was a new NDD in an existing trial with another NDD
# 2) multiple NDD detected that we then found at least one was new compared to existing NDD listed as condition in a trial
#    we were already tracking as of interest (since it had a NDD listed in conditions)
# 3) multple NDD detected in a trial that had no NDD listed as conditions. Truly a new trial discovered. This one needs us
#    to pull data from our raw files so we can get all the trial info.

# For all three of these I need to classify the interventions listed to generate new tables (or append to existing?)
# For now my big focus is to get the drug ones, but will expand to all intervention types. All that code I wrote/is done
# for the other NDD trials, I just have to adapt it so it works here without crashing :D
